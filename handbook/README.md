luck to find this book, when check C-style IO, and this book contain all the methods I get from internet
good, let's start

## ch4 data structures
### dynamic array
!! std::string is also dynamic array

### set structures
std::set self-balance-tree, base operation in &\theta(logn)&
std::unordered_set hashing function, basic operation in $\theta(1)$

### map structures
wait, for looking for repeat value in a array,
I could use map<value_t, int> to map from value to the number of value, great could solve in $\theta(n)$
I also could use std::set or std::unorder_setto find values...
this is like

### iterators and ranges

### other structures
bitset, interesting
queue
deque, two sides
priority queue, interesting
stack
policy-based data structures

### comparsion to sorting

## ch05 complete search
### generating subsets
### generating permutation

```

### backtracking
8-queen question
recurrence function,
way1, recurrence by parameter
way2, recurrence by static data

### prunting the search
recap: function pointer and lambda function in std::qsort
here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lambda-expression-in-c/
some good std functions to use lambda: std::sort, std::find_if, std::count

fancy output:
only printf fprintf sprintf
when output to terminal, could make use of terminal codes(ANSI/VT100), some useful code show here: http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/scripting/terminalcodes
\a terminal bell
\b backspace
\t horizontial tab
\n new line
\v vertical tab
\f new page
\r carriage return
\e[<X>;<Y>H home-position to X and Y coordinates
\e[0K  clear line from current cursor position to end of line
\e[1K  clear lien from beginning to current cursor
\e[2K  clear whole line
\e[<X>m text attributes and coloring

multithread, one to do calculation and one to indicate this process is still alive

### meet in the middle
it's the divide and conquer algorithm
sum of subset

## ch6 greedy algorithms

### coin problem
nice choice of euro coins,
for any sum x, the opitimal construction must contain largest coin that samller or equal to x
that's to say, for any coin C_i and C_{i+1}, 2*C_i <= C_{i+1}

### scheduling
in next possible events, choose the one ends as earliest as possible

### tasks and deadlines
finish shortest task

### minimizing sums
sum = \sum_{i=0}^N abs(a_i -x), x is the median
sum = \sum_{i=0}^N pow(a_i -x, 2), x is the mean

### data compression
huffman coding

coding: use huffman to code 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 in pi million bits
while, you never know it unless you code with it
recap: const_cast<>() static_cast<>() dynamic_cast<>() reinterpret_cast<>(), here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/const_cast-in-c-type-casting-operators/
unbelieve it takes me 3 hours to finish this part, std::unordered_set<use-pointer> because of hash
TODO: read latter: https://thispointer.com/how-to-use-unordered_set-with-user-defined-classes-tutorial-example/
TODO: read latter: std::heap

this is like finish the rest of basic techniques

## ch07 Dynamic programming
### coin problem
### longest incresing subsequence
n^2 is easy to understand
!!: nlogn here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-monotonically-increasing-subsequence-size-n-log-n/
TODO: code this
this is like, every update make subsequence lower
    1. If A[i] is smallest among all end
    candidates of active lists, we will start
    new active list of length 1.
    2. If A[i] is largest among all end candidates of
    active lists, we will clone the largest active
    list, and extend it by A[i].
    3. If A[i] is in between, we will find a list with
    largest end element that is smaller than A[i].
    Clone and extend this list by A[i]. We will discard all
    other lists of same length as that of this modified list.


### path in grid
TODO: coding it, easy

### knapsack problem
TODO: coding it, easy
if there is a n elements, a_0~a_n, and the Sum could be S
by the recurrence formula, need to calculate n*S result

### edit distance
666

### counting tilings
TODO: need problems


## ch8 Amortized analysis
### two pointers method
- subarray sum
- two sum
- 3sum problem
here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3SUM
$\theta(n^2)$ method:
way1: for each i and j in array, find S-X[i]-X[j], using hash table so we can do search in $\theta(1) time$
so what using hash table means in c++ is to use std::unorderd_map<int, int> hash
way2: sort array, loop array with a; for each X[a], only need to find b and c in X[a+1 ~ n-1] such that X[b]+ X[c] = S - X[a]
- subset sum
here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem
there is a Pseudo-polynomial time dynamic programming solution in this wiki page

### mearst smaller elements

TODO: I need a application of this question ??

### binary index tree
TODO: come back with application
this is a tree that I never see

### segment tree
TODO: come back with application

### addtional techniques

## ch10 Bit manipulation
### bit represent
the magic of design signed integer,
Twoâ€™s complement is used, which means that the opposite number of a number is calculated by first inverting all the bits in the number, and then increasing the number by one.
the signed number -x equals the unsigned number 2^n-x
seems that I never use (nor)~x in coding
~x = -x-1

### bit operation
x | (1<<k) set kth bit to 1
x & ~(1<<k) set kth bit to 0
x ^ (1<<k) invert kth bit

```cpp
    int x = 5328; // 00000000000000000001010011010000
    std::cout << __builtin_clz(x) << "\n"; // 19, the number of zeros in the begining of number
    std::cout << __builtin_ctz(x) << "\n"; // 4, the number of zeros in the end of number
    std::cout << __builtin_popcount(x) << "\n"; // 5, the number of ones
    std::cout << __builtin_parity(x) << "\n"; // 1, the parity (even or odd) of the number of ones
```

### representing sets
```c++
    for(int b{0}; b< (1<<n); b++){
        if(__builtin_popcount(b) == k){
            // process subset with exactly k elements
        }
    }

    int b=0;
    do{
        // process subsets of x
    }while(b=(b-x)&x);
    // 66, think of  it as -(x-b) & x, and -x = ~x+1
```

## bit optimizations
### hamming distances
it has significate disadvantage, k<32 and each character only have 2 values
better to use divide and conquer

### counting subgrids
66, it's cool because don't need to process them one element by one element, could do them 32 by 32 or 64 by 64
make 32 seconds to 1 seconds

## Dynamic programming
### optimal selection

### from permutations to subsets
6666
but limited to 64 bits, unless use std::bitset, like array of bool
subsets problem is 2^n
permutation problem is n!
they are bad for computer
TODO: code this using std::bitset

### counting subsets
wanna find subsets of S{0b1101 1100}
```cpp
    for(int p{0}; p<(1<<N); p++){
        if(p&S !=0 && p&~S ==0){
            // p is a subset of S
        }
    }
```
TODO: come back for subsets problem

    b = p_1^{\beta_1} * p_2^{\beta_2} * ... * p_n^{\beta_n}
    gcd(a, b) = p_1^{min(\alpha_1, \beta_1)} * p_2^{min(\alpha_2, \beta_2)} * ... * p_n^{min(\alpha_n, \beta_n)}
    lcm(a, b) = p_1^{max(\alpha_1, \beta_1)} * p_2^{max(\alpha_2, \beta_2)} * ... * p_n^{max(\alpha_n, \beta_n)}

    crazy:
    prove of Euclid's algorithm ?: recall that c|a in number theory means c is a factor of a. here: https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse311/14au/slides/lecture13.pdf

        int gcd(int a, int b){
            if(b==0) return a;

        u = (u*u) % m;
